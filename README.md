## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a creative approach to software development that emphasizes rapid prototyping, playful experimentation, and expressive user interfaces. Instead of focusing solely on traditional requirements, vibe coding encourages developers to explore new ideas, iterate quickly, and build apps that feel dynamic and engaging.
